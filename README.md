# capstone_project_game aka "Orderly Chaos"
This project will be a video game developed in Unity using the industry standard C#. The game will include procedural generation of environments and demonstrate enemy AI.

### How to Play

    - WASD: for movement
    - Mouse movement + left click: for aiming and attacking
    - Spacebar: for dashing
    - Escape: to bring up the pause menu

### UPDATE
 - playable testing version available to public!!!!

### The timeline for the project
- By Milestone 1/Week 7 - Simple Generation of Environment and combat.
- By Milestone 2/Week 11 - Procedural Generation of Environment in order to allow for "levels." Or one singular larger procedurally generated world.
- By MileStone 3/Week 14 - Fleshout story/Incorpate polishing
Note: This Timeline is hopeful at best. (Got through Milestone 2's goals. Narative elements will come in future updates.)

- Animated and moving character sprite
- Main Menu/Script with a play button that moves from main menu to game screen

- Added Health and combat features
- Created a simple enemy AI player and enemy are able to defeat eachother
- Added a dash and attack knockback. 
- Precedurally Generated Environment, Enemies, Objects(jars, barrels), and rune portals (which serves as traversal through levels)

- Enemy AI improved through use of Context steering

### Features to work on
- More combat features (different attacks/abilities)?
